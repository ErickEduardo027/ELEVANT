// What OccMap shares with its DOM overlays and with the panels around it, so a list or a switcher needs no ref:
// - state: `engineStatus` ('starting' | 'ready' | 'unavailable'), `basemapStatus` ('off' | 'loading' | 'ok' |
//   'degraded'), `activeView` (the view the camera really shows, from presetForZoom), `fits` and `thresholds`;
// - meta: `standsOnScreen`, the stands drawn one by one in the area the insets leave in sight (the legend lists only
//   those; while the map gathers stands into clusters, the ones it still draws on their own), `standsGrouped`,
//   whether a cluster of stands is drawn there, and `flightsOnScreen`, the flights drawn in that area (the list
//   changes when other flights come into sight, not when they move inside it);
// - actions: `requestView(view, { terminal })` flies and writes `view=` in the URL, `flyToPreset(view, { terminal })`
//   only flies, `flyToStand(code, { minZoom })` centres a stand and `flyToFlight(id, { minZoom })` a flight.
// Outside an OccMap the value is a map that does nothing and shows nothing.
